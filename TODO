The TODO's here are for delphinusdnsd which is the successor of wildcarddnsd.
Please see http://delphinusdns.org for updates/news.

For 1.5.0 release
- make sure an RRset has the same TTL, we don't need TTL in a single RR because
  the set requires per RFC 2181 section 5.2 to be the same in the RRset.
- CAA RR support
- a github mirrored copy
- an OpenBSD port/package starting with 1.4.1 release	[IN THE WORKS]
- fix the DNSSEC and delphinusdnsd(?) code so that an algorithm rollover works
	[POSSIBLY DONE]
- filter input to dddctl query for escape codes.
- inside axfrloop the axfr child is chrooted, which gives it GMT timezone, this
  could have effects on sending notifies, noticed at 00:47 in a +1 timezone,
  add the timeinfo as a variable before chroot'ing.
- Shape up the NSEC code as it seems NSEC is having a renaissance, at least
to have replicant compatibility for NSEC

For 1.4.0 release
- a github mirrored copy
- fix the DNSSEC code so that a KSK key rollover is allowed	[DONE]
- TSIG support would still be nice				[DONE]
- CAA RR support
- More ciphers for signing (GOST, ECDSA, Elliptic Curves)	[ECDSA DONE]
- Replicant/Slave AXFR mode (with TSIG)				[DONE]
- Redo TCP support						[DONE]

For 1.3.0 release
- fix the DNSSEC code so that a key rollover is allowed	 [PARTIALLY DONE]
- sign zones immediately at startup which doesn't require a zonesigner
  this would be coupled with a dynamic dns system which automatically adds/up-
  dates	new NSEC3 and RRSIG's for new records.
- TSIG support would still be nice

For 1.2.0 release
- sign zones immediately at startup which doesn't require a zonesigner
  this would be coupled with a dynamic dns system which automatically adds/up-
  dates	new NSEC3 and RRSIG's for new records.
- TSIG support would still be nice
- allow AXFR to bind to port 53 and pass it from main engine to axfr engine
  via descriptor passing  [DONE]
- CNAME's with DNSSEC are broken, due to a missing RRSIG, recursive servers 
  return SERVFAIL [DONE]

For 1.1.0 release

- either a zonesigner (instead of relying on BIND's) or   [DONE]
- signing zones immediately at startup which doesn't require a zonesigner
- TSIG support would still be nice
- allow AXFR to bind to port 53 and pass it from main engine to axfr engine
  via descriptor passing


For 1.0.0 release

- TSIG (RFC 2845) support
- partition the struct domain, so that we have selective sizes based on
  what records exist.  This is a lot of work but will make records under 44KB
  again. [DONE]
- DNSSEC (RFC 4034 / DNSKEY RR, DS RR, RRSIG RR, NSEC RR) [DONE]
- Notify needs to be rewritten for allowing notifies to different slaves.
- A zone signer possibly written in ruby. [PARTIALLY DONE]


Anything else would be nice but I have to put it on the backburner...

* Slave AXFR would be nice (advanced)
* HINFO support (junior devels) 
* openbsd port support (for 5.0/5.1 perhaps?) (junior/intermediate)
* windows port (advanced)
* Dynamic DNS support (advanced)
