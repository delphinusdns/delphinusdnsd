The TODO's here are for delphinusdnsd which is the successor of wildcarddnsd.
Please see http://delphinusdns.centroid.eu for updates/news.

For 1.1.0 release

- either a zonesigner (instead of relying on BIND's) or 
- signing zones immediately at startup which doesn't require a zonesigner
- TSIG support would still be nice


For 1.0.0 release

- TSIG (RFC 2845) support
- partition the struct domain, so that we have selective sizes based on
  what records exist.  This is a lot of work but will make records under 44KB
  again.
- DNSSEC (RFC 4034 / DNSKEY RR, DS RR, RRSIG RR, NSEC RR)
- Notify needs to be rewritten for allowing notifies to different slaves.
- A zone signer possibly written in ruby.


Anything else would be nice but I have to put it on the backburner...

* Slave AXFR would be nice (advanced)
* HINFO support (junior devels) 
* recursing and caching support rewrite (super advanced)
* openbsd port support (for 5.0/5.1 perhaps?) (junior/intermediate)
* recursing/caching todo's: (super advanced)

	- add CNAME traversal so that www.yahoo.com would be listing both CNAME's and
	the A RR.  While doing that it should check for CNAME loops.
	- zone expiry in then DB database on a timely basis...
	- retransmissions of queries in both IPv4 and IPv6
	- a way to turn off IPv6 on hosts that have IPv6 disabled.
	- a good debug why a lookup of solarscale.de flooded the nameserverservice.de
	  nameservers until abort().
	- error catchings if a server fails (SERVFAIL).
	- pthread support

* windows port (advanced)
* Dynamic DNS support (advanced)
