The TODO's here are for delphinusdnsd which is the successor of wildcarddnsd.
Please see http://delphinusdns.centroid.eu for updates/news.

For 1.2.0 release
- sign zones immediately at startup which doesn't require a zonesigner
  this would be coupled with a dynamic dns system which automatically adds/up-
  dates	new NSEC3 and RRSIG's for new records.
- TSIG support would still be nice
- allow AXFR to bind to port 53 and pass it from main engine to axfr engine
  via descriptor passing  [DONE]
- CNAME's with DNSSEC are broken, due to a missing RRSIG, recursive servers
  return SERVFAIL

For 1.1.0 release

- either a zonesigner (instead of relying on BIND's) or   [DONE]
- signing zones immediately at startup which doesn't require a zonesigner
- TSIG support would still be nice
- allow AXFR to bind to port 53 and pass it from main engine to axfr engine
  via descriptor passing


For 1.0.0 release

- TSIG (RFC 2845) support
- partition the struct domain, so that we have selective sizes based on
  what records exist.  This is a lot of work but will make records under 44KB
  again. [DONE]
- DNSSEC (RFC 4034 / DNSKEY RR, DS RR, RRSIG RR, NSEC RR) [DONE]
- Notify needs to be rewritten for allowing notifies to different slaves.
- A zone signer possibly written in ruby. [PARTIALLY DONE]


Anything else would be nice but I have to put it on the backburner...

* Slave AXFR would be nice (advanced)
* HINFO support (junior devels) 
* openbsd port support (for 5.0/5.1 perhaps?) (junior/intermediate)
* windows port (advanced)
* Dynamic DNS support (advanced)
