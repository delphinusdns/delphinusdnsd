Delphinus DNS is a non-caching, non-recursing DNS server that serves 
authoritative answers for A, AAAA, CAA, CDNSKEY, CDS, CNAME, DNSKEY, DS, 
HINFO, LOC, MX, NAPTR, NS, NSEC3, NSEC3PARAM, PTR, RP, RRSIG, SOA, SRV, 
SSHFP, TLSA, TXT, and ZONEMD resource records.  It serves both on IPv4 and 
IPv6.
</p> <p>
Delphinusdnsd is able to restrict answers to a hash of an IP/IPv6 between 1 
and 127 packets per second.  Unfortunately due to the algorithm of this the
more pps you ratelimit the higher the memory footprint of delphinusdnsd.
</p> <p>
Delphinusdnsd from version 1.5.0 onwards can act as a forwarder, and can 
utilize a secure channel granted with TSIG protection (shared keys).
</p> <p>
Delphinusdnsd is developed on the OpenBSD Operating System.  Ports to FreeBSD,
NetBSD, and Linux exist.  It is written in the C programming language.  It was
developed while the main programmer lived in Germany, European Union.

The name "delphinus" was picked in honor of a constellation in the northern
hemispheres summer night sky.  The logo on this webpage is actually an overlay
of an actual photo taken of this constellation, so it is to scale.  Since
delphinus has weird names for its stars such as Rotanev and Sualocin which
were named by an Italian astronomer after his own name, delphinusdns then fits
as being a weird name-server.  Lastly dolphins are an interesting species on
earth, do they utilize call-names one may wonder?  The image below was drawn
for OpenBSD 6.7 and I thought I'd include it, it is fan-art.
