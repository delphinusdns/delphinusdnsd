<h2><a name="whatis">What is DNS?</a></h2>
<p>
DNS is an acronym for Domain Name System.  In laymans terms it means, it does
the looking up of domain names on the Internet.  In professional circles,
looking up is called resolving.  So a domain name resolves if a DNS server
exists and is configured on the Internet, serving it.
</p><p>
What is a domain name?  delphinusdns.org, centroid.eu are domain
names.  Just "delphinusdns" and "centroid" are called dns labels, same with
org and eu.  A domain name with the name of "www.centroid.eu." has three 
labels then where the .eu label is also called the Top Level Domain or TLD.
Centroid inside "www.centroid.eu." is called 2nd level domain and www is also 
called 3rd level domain.
</p><p>
Really a domain name has a trailing dot, like "www.centroid.eu." this 
indicates that there is a root.  The root looks sort of like this...
<pre>

                                .  root     
                               / \
                              /   \
                             /     \
                          org       eu
                         /   \     /  \
                        /              \
                    delphinusdns      centroid

             [1] The (partial) DNS tree showing the root at top.

</pre>
When a domain name lookup is made for "centroid.eu." first the root is consulted
for the .eu nameservers, then the .eu nameservers are consulted for the
centroid.eu. domain name.  It is a distributed database in other words, because
the nameservers along the way can belong to different organizations and 
networks.  Please see <a href="https://iana.org">iana.org</a> for different
TLD's.
</p>
<h3><a name="terminology">Terminology</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>DNS - Domain Name System</li>
<li>DNS Label - the LABEL in LABEL.centroid.eu or the WWW in WWW.delphinusdns.org</li>
<li>domain name - www.delphinusdns.org is a domain name, centroid.eu is a domain name</li>
<li>RR - Resource Record, a type of record served by a dns server</li>
<li>DNS server - the program that answers to a DNS query</li>
<li>A Record - a RR of type A</li>
<li>AAAA record - quad-A Record a RR that serves IPv6 answers</li>
<li>BIND - Berkeley Internet Name Daemon (a nameserver)</li>
<li>UDP - User Datagram Protocol</li>
<li>TCP - Transmission Control Protocol (<a href="http://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793.txt">RFC 793</a>)</li>
<li>TTL - Time to Live, in DNS a time to live is usually associated with an RR,
      in IP (Internet Protocol) the TTL is the hop count of a packet</li>
<li>TLV - Type, Length and Value</li>
<li>LV - Length and Value</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="recursive">Recursive and Authoritative Nameservers</a></h2>
<p>
A nameserver that looks up entire domain names from the root, is said to be
a recursive nameserver.  A nameserver that only answers the domain that it
is authoritative for is an authoritative nameserver.  Both types have a 
place on the Internet with recursive nameservers being BIND, Unbound, 
djbdns, etc.  All these can serve as authoritative nameservers as well.
</p>
<h3><a name="turnkey">Turnkey vs. General Purpose DNS Server</a></h3>
<p>
<a href="http://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5936.txt">RFC 5936</a> mentions two specific types of Implementations on page 4.
<pre>
   "General-purpose DNS implementation" refers to DNS software developed
   for widespread use.  This includes resolvers and servers freely
   accessible as libraries and standalone processes.  This also includes
   proprietary implementations used only in support of DNS service
   offerings.

   "Turnkey DNS implementation" refers to custom-made, single-use
   implementations of DNS.  Such implementations consist of software
   that employs the DNS protocol message format yet does not conform to
   the entire range of DNS functionality.
</pre>
So then BIND is a General-purpose DNS implementation.  Delphinusdnsd is 
half way between Turnkey and General-purpose.
</p>

<h2><a name="delphinusdnsd">Delphinusdnsd</a></h2>
<p>
Delphinusdnsd was conceived in 2005 and laid down on November 29th, 2005.
It was designed to give false answers inside a firewalled intranet.  Why
this was done, was so that DNS could be isolated but still give rudamentary
answers.  A program called <b>authpf</b> would switch between delphinusdnsd and
BIND to give lookups to a firewalled and then authenticated Wifi user.  At 
first delphinusdnsd was programmed on OpenBSD and on April 10th, 2008 it 
was ported to Linux.  At that time it ran on NetBSD, FreeBSD, DragonflyBSD, 
OpenBSD and Redhat Linux.  
</p><p>
The concept of a firewalled DNS doesn't fly very well with caching name
resolvers that are found on Windows and Solaris, so I just kept hacking
away with the goal of a General Purpose Nameserver in mind.
</p><p>
Delphinusdnsd tries not to reuse too much code, especially in the DNS 
operations.  Importing DNS code from other projects is a nono.  I want to
build something on my own because I want to show a robustness stemming
from an independent source.  This means if there is a bug in BIND it won't
be copied over in Delphinusdnsd.
</p><p>
Delphinusdnsd is now an authoritative nameserver.  It serves both IPv4 and IPv6
since its inception.  It can be configured to serve a number of Resource 
Records (RR's).   With the -l option set on delphinusdnsd all queries made 
to it are logged.  What's logged is the time of day, remote IP/IP6 of the 
recursive resolver, the RR in question and the domain name being looked up.

<h2><a name="resourcerecords">Resource Records</a></h2>
<p>
With help of gotweb and cvs2git conversion programs I was able to reconstruct
how delphinusdnsd grew over time.  Much respect to myself in November 2005 for
writing the then named wildcarddnsd in a few weeks time (I'm guessing 3 to 5).
Below shows the addition of RR's in some chronology.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>A, AAAA, MX, NS, SOA, PTR, CNAME, TXT</b><br>
In the original check-in at sourceforge in November 2005 under the name 
"wildcarddnsd",
delphinusdnsd had support for only eight RR's.  These were limited to 512 bytes
reply length as per RFC 1035 and did not do EDNS0 (which came much later).  
delphinusdnsd at that time did have NOTIMPL reply and NXDOMAIN as well.</li>
<li><b>AXFR, IXFR, SRV, ANY</b><br>
By May 2012, four more RR's made it into the tree. ANY is really a pseudo-RR
that dumps an entire domainname's RRset.</li> 
<li><b>NAPTR, OPT, SSHFP</b><br>
By June 2014, three more RR's came.  NAPTR which was important for VOIP (and
complements SRV), SSHFP which has fingerprint signatures for SSH and the
pseudo-RR OPT which is needed for EDNS0.</li>
<li><b>TLSA, NSEC3, NSEC3PARAM, RRSIG, DNSKEY, DS</b><br>
By July 2016, the DNSSEC RR's came into the tree.  Though technically NSEC also
came it's status today is undefined, I don't know what it'll do.  TLSA is needed
for DANE, and really only makes sense with integrity of DNSSEC.  At this time
delphinusdnsd just had the namechange to delphinusdnsd to indicate a new era.
</li>
<li><b>RP, HINFO, CAA</b><br>
came into being by August 2020.  It needs to be said that as time progresses
adding an RR becomes more complex, as by now we had a whole bunch of
dependencies on different operations in delphinusdnsd.</li>
<li><b>ZONEMD, CDS, CDNSKEY, LOC</b><br>
support came by November 2021.  delphinusdnsd can now give out locations of
hostnames and organisations.  The RR's other than LOC require some magic to be
done with dddctl still.  It is worth noting that TXT and CNAME also saw some
improvement over the years.
</ul>
</p>
<h2><a name="obstacles">Design obstacles</a></h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Compression</b><br>
<p>
A label in a domain name is the FOO in FOO.centroid.eu.  It is a LV (length,
value) concept where every label is prepended with the length of the actual
label.  So FOO.centroid.eu would look like 3FOO 8centroid 2eu 0.  The domain
name is terminated with a length of 0.  When there is a DNS packet with 
several domain names then compression can be used.  Since there is up to
63 characters in a label, the label length itself occupies the low 6 bits
of the 8 bit ASCII character.  The 2 high bits (0xC0) when set indicate a
compression pointer otherwise they must be set to zero.
<pre>

  8    7    6    5    4    3    2    1          bit 
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|0x80|0x40|0x20|0x10|0x8 |0x4 |0x2 |0x1 |       value
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|   0xC0  |        0-63 (0x3F)          |       combined
+---------+-----------------------------+
</pre>

So when there is a domain name that matches fully or partially to a domain
name that is being added to a DNS packet you can compress it.  A compression
pointer is by property 16 bits long and thus can hold 14 bits of offset from
the beginning of the packet so 16384 bytes.  This means a domain name can
be compressed to a previous domain name that resides in the beginning 16384
bytes of a DNS packet this is somewhat a limitation on 65535 maximum length
TCP DNS packets.
</p><p>
In Delphinusdnsd the compression was rewritten on April 12th, 2009 when 
W was in BETA_5 version.  Previous versions of compression was less 
efficient but packed more.  They were also buggy so that they prompted 
rewrite.  This is hard code and can break heads.
</p><p>
The way Delphinusdnsd adds compression is to append a name to the end of
a dns packet (buffer) and then parses the first 100 resource records and 
their respective names:
<pre>
       for (i = 1; i < 100; i++) {
</pre>
in an array it records the offset of the label.  Then when it runs a second
time in a loop it does a memcasecmp() which is a memory compare that knows a 
bit about ASCII characters and their respective cases.
<pre>
	if (memcasecmp(e, p, checklen) == 0) {
</pre>
What happens then the offset is stored at the end of the buffer where the
dns name first resided and a 0xC0 is added.  The buffer offset is then
trimmed to only show the size of the compression pointer.
</p></li>
<li><b>AXFR</b><br>
<p>
AXFR is a DNS Zone Transfer.  There is 2 types.  AXFR and IXFR.  AXFR is a 
full zone transfer and IXFR is an incremental transfer.  Although both types
are supported in Delphinusdnsd, a zone is always transferred as a whole and
never increment.  AXFR was added September 19th, 2011.  IXFR followed a few
days later as it was simple to do with full dumps.  In 2019 TSIG was added
to protect AXFR's (See TSIG).  A TSIG will be inserted every 89th envelope
in an AXFR.  Also have a look at Replicant support below.
</p></li>
<li><b>ANY RR answers</b><br>
<p>
The ANY RR lists all RR's found for a certain domain name.  If at the root
of a "zone" this may contain an SOA, NS, A and AAAA records, but any type will
do really.  Delphinusdnsd attained ANY query support through a special request
by Alexander Dzuba, on December 27th, 2010.  Seasons Greetings!  The functions
that were written for the ANY requests were usable at a later time for the
AXFR code where basically the BTREE is walked and the fitting domain names
are written to a packet with the ANY method.  It's possible that a DNS reply
gets the truncation flag and gets truncated when spouting ANY RR's.
</p></li>
<li><b>Recursion</b><br>
<p>
I tried recursion a few years ago.  It's really hard to implement so I
decided to stay with an authoritative nameserver for the time being.
</p></li>
<li><b>Round-Robin DNS</b><br>
<p>
Appeared in Delphinusdnsd on November 3rd, 2009.  It is a simple integer in
the zone that gets updated with every lookup.  With a MOD determination the
A, AAAA, and NS records are rotated.  This was prodded by Evgeniy Bogdanov
who gave incredible input back.  In 2019 the way round robin works changed.
The TAILQ_LAST() is removed and added on the head, (TAILQ_INSERT_HEAD()).
This shuffles the records in a manner as seen before.
</p></li>
<li><b>Split-Horizon DNS</b><br>
<p>
Was implemented for A RR records (IPv4) on March 27th, 2010.  It's for IPv4
functionality but lookups through IPv6 can also be weighed.  This feature
requires a homogenous delphinusdnsd dns setup and is pretty useless if you
want to slave with BIND.  This feature has been turned off in delphinusdnsd
version 1.0.0 due to complications with DNSSEC.
</p></li>
<li><b>Wildcarding</b><br>
<p>
Delphinusdnsd has disabled wildcarding in version 1.0.0.  It took 10 years.
In 2019 FreeLogic considered a fork, with my blessings, time will tell if
wildcarddnsd gets revived.
</p></li>
<li><b>Truncation</b><br>
<p>
Has been fixed in delphinusdnsd-1.0.0, before it would truncate at the wrong
spot.  The fix also honors different sizes as negotiated with EDNS.  This was
revisited in 2017 with delphinusdnsd-1.2.0 and truncated answers now give an
"empty answer" back.  This prevents complications with wrong record counts.
</p></li>
<li><b>TCP</b><br>
<p>
TCP support came to Delphinusdnsd on March 12th, 2010, so relatively late.
TCP support is a needed function in DNS and MUST be supported according to
many DNS related RFC's.  Unfortunately when a dns packet gets truncated in
UDP it will also get truncated in TCP even though TCP supports a packet
length of up to 65535 characters.  This still needs work.  The AXFR function
which is solely TCP is seperated from the main dns code so that there is
no possibility for a denial of service while a zone transfer takes place.
</p></li>
<li><b>IPv6</b><br>
<p>
IPv6 support has been in delphinusdnsd from day one.
</p></li>
<li><b>SRV RR</b><br>
<p>
SRV support came in April 2012.  It is based heavily on the MX RR and has not
been tested as much as the author would like.  Feedback is always welcome.
</p></li>
<li><b>TSIG support</b><br>
<p>
TSIG support came finally in early 2019.  RFC 2845 was a hard read, and the
2845bis draft seems to be promising for future implementors.
</p></li>
<li><b>Replicant support</b><br>
<p>
Before 2020, delphinusdnsd could not AXFR as a replicant.  It can do it now
where it does an AXFR from a master zone, including checking for TSIG and
writes it to /etc/delphinusdns/replicant/ directory.  This directory must
be created before or this won't work.
</p>
<p>
The download creates a temporary file.  If there is any errors the temporary
file will be abandoned for inspection.  It's a good idea to keep an eye on
the replicant directory becuase of this or the filesystem may fill up.
Depending how the retry values of the SOA are one can clean these out per
crontab.  Once a successful download is made the temporary file is linked to
the right zone file and delphinusdnsd is restarted to take on the new changes.
</p></li>
<li><b>Forwarding support</b>
<p>
Forwarding came in 2020 with 1.5.0.  The cache is toggleable on and off.  When
it's on, there is certain requests it will not cache for, ANY for example.  As
there is a slight bug with inserting RR's into the cache I suspect.  With ANY
RR's it caused duplicate entries.  With cache toggle off it will just pass
thru all requests, but this can get costly over the Internet.  The handbook
has some writings on how I use the forwarders, and this seems to work.  The
forwarding was directly inspired by BIND which can also forward with TSIG, so
in essence I have replaced the need to run BIND at home.
</p></li>
<li><b>IPC</b>
<p>
IPC stands for Inter Process Communication, and delphinusdnsd uses a lot of
it due to its design having chosen fork() instead of threads.  To use fork()
allows delphinusdnsd to pledge() and unveil() on each component.  But recent
(1.6.0) IPC methods may offset some of the security because we're increasingly
using shared memory instead of socketpair (part of imsg framework) in order
to be faster by sending less through the sockets.  In fact in many cases we
write to the shared memory and then message the other process with an imsg
packet that there is data waiting.  The shared memory is divided up in slots
and all we send is the slot number.  There is a simple basic locking mechanism
that should be good enough to detect races on this shared memory.  The locking
may serialize all operations around the lock.
</p></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="dnssec">Design obstacles with DNSSEC</a></h2>
<p>
DNSSEC was added in 2015, where I basically coded every single time I had off.
To do DNSSEC effectively, EDNS has to work right.  In version 1.0.0 
delphinusdnsd
will reply a BADVERS packet to any version other than 0.  We're actually 
EDNS compliant, (see here: <a href="https://ednscomp.isc.org/ednscomp/5a70566c18">https://ednscomp.isc.org/ednscomp/5a70566c18</a>).
Also all 7 extra RR's (DNSKEY, RRSIG, NSEC, NSEC3, NSEC3PARAM, DS, TLSA) 
have been added to do DNSSEC and DANE.  The code had to be modified in 
reply_* to add an RRSIG record when dnssec is enabled.  (NSEC is shaky since
we went straight with RFC 5155 NSEC3 for signing and use).
</p><p>
Also reply_nxdomain had to be modified to give NSEC3 answers.  The way
these DNSSEC RR's make it into the server is to run the zone file through
a tool which does conversions to DNSSEC.   In version 1.0.0 I created a ruby 
tool called dd-convert.rb, which called the BIND tools, dnssec-keygen and 
dnssec-signzone, and then converts that back to delphinusdnsd
zonefile format.  I also had sponsored Luke Antins who added DNSSEC support 
to his ruby gem dns-zone which I use to parse the BIND zonefile.  A second 
sponsorship
to get TLSA support into dns-zone, to have DANE support, never materialized.
</p><p>
So then in version 1.1.0 I redid the ruby tool into a C tool that doesn't rely
on BIND tools, and does TLSA signing for DANE.  Ruby is not being used anymore
but it was perhaps a good prototyping program. The NSEC RR support has not 
ever been tested and could be buggy, in fact you cannot dd-convert to anything 
other than NSEC3 support by default, changing this means changing the code.
</p>
<h3><a name="errors">DNSSEC errors</a></h3>
<p>
In 2016 some DNSSEC errors were detected in the Implementation:
<ul>
<li>RRSIG's should be multiple RRSIG's per RR which it is currently not.  This
   is needed for key rollover which the current version of delphinusdnsd does
   not do.</li>
<li>Key rollover is not supported as hinted on in a), it is a little like the
   root zone DNSKEY which seldomly gets rotated in our case, never.  Subsequent
   versions (perhaps 1.1.0) will support key rollover.
</li>
</ul>
In 2019 key rollovers were programmed, however:
<ul>
<li>Algorithm rollover (including key bit changes) are not yet supported.</li>
<li>Multiple RRSIG's are only allowed in DNSKEY's so far, this limits the
methods available for use with rollovers.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3><a name="supported">Supported DNSSEC Algorithms in Delphinusdnsd</a></h3>

RFC 8624 has a chart like this in section 3.1:

This is somewhat what the new internal database looks like:

There is a struct rbtree which is a node in the RB TREE, it has a pointer to 
a TAILQ of type struct rrset, which in turn has a pointer to a TAILQ of type
struct rr.  From there a void * pointer points to the type of struct it is
which is also indicated in struct rrset.

<h3><a name="reason">Reason</a></h3>
<p>
The reason this was done was to save memory, and compared to an NSD slave it
does brilliantly.
