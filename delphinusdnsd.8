.Sh NAME
.Nm delphinusdnsd
.Nd the Delphinus DNS daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm delphinusdnsd
.Op Fl dlv
.Op Fl b Ar address
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl I Ar identstring
.Op Fl i Ar interface
.Op Fl n Ar instances
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Op Fl s Ar path
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the daemon that runs Delphinus DNS.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
.Ar address
Adds an 
.Ar address 
that
.Nm
should 
.Xr bind 2
to.  This option can be repeated multiple times to add more. May
not be used in conjunction with 
.Fl i .
.It Fl d
Turn on debug mode.  
.Nm 
does not fork into the background with this.  Messages are printed in the 
foreground.
.It Fl f
.Ar file
The configuration file to be used is found at 
.Ar file .
.It Fl I
.Ar identstring
Allows the operator to specify an identification string to reflect in the
process listing and subsequent 
.Xr dddctl 8 
start/stop/restart commands.  This helps identifying the processes when many
.Nm
run in a system.  May not be used in conjunction with
.Fl s .
.It Fl i
.Ar interface
The particular
.Ar interface 
that 
.Nm
should listen on.  This option can be specified multiple times.  May not be
used in conjunction with 
.Fl b .
.It Fl l
Turn logging of queries on.
.It Fl n
.Ar instances
is the number of instances plus one that should be forked for 
.Nm .
This may be good for multi-cpu/core boxes.
.It Fl p
.Ar port
Specifies the 
.Ar port
that 
.Nm 
should listen on.
.It Fl s
.Ar path
Specifies the socket path to use with 
.Xr dddctl 8 .
May not be used in conjunction with 
.Fl I .
.It Fl v
Be more verbose in debug mode.  This shows configfile parsing logic.
.El
.Pp
.Nm 
is an authoritative DNS server.  It can run as primary or replicant.
When new configfiles are written it must be restarted.  For replicants that
receive notifies or timeout on the refresh or retry SOA values the daemon is
restarted automatically. 
.Pp
It should be noted that 
.Nm
has a forwarding mode since version 1.5.  This mode should be treated as 
experimental.
