; WARNING - 	the way wildcarddnsd originally implemented wildcarding is
;		wrong and can cause damage on the Internet (DoS), it can	
;		also cause damage on someone using wildcarding, so it's best
;		to turn it off.  By default anyone wanting to turn wildcarding
;		on should enable the "wildcard-only-for" block as shown below.
;
; comment the below block to turn wildcarding off
;
wildcard-only-for "my IP's" {
	2001:a60:f074::8/128;
	::1/128;
        ; this is a comment
        ; if this option isn't mentioned, then wildcarding is off
        ; this will remove the -W option in the command line
}


zone "default" {
	; comments must be at the beginning of a new line, # and ; is allowed
	;
	;
	; ALL RR's begine with:  zone,RR,time to live, ...
	;
	; names can be expressed with no trailing . or with trailing dot either way
	; they'll be modified to have a trailing dot.
	; example: www.google.com or www.google.com. becomes www.google.com.
	;
	; soa RR consists of: zone, SOA, ttl of RR, nameserver, responsible person, 
	; serial, refresh, retry, expire, zone time to live (no spaces)
	;
	*,soa,3600,neptune.ATLAS.,pbug.neptune.ATLAS,1,3600,1800,7200,3600
	;
	; a RR consists of:  zone, A, ttl of RR, IP  (no spaces)
	; up to 10 addresses allowed
	;
	*,a,3600,10.0.0.2
	*,a,3600,10.0.0.1
	;

	;
	; all of *.com looks like this:
	;
	com,soa,3600,a.com,b.com,1,3600,1800,300000,3600
	;
	; CNAME RR consists of: zone, CNAME, ttl of RR, name 	(no spaces)
	; CNAME support is currently not complete since a CNAME must attach the
	; records it is pointing to... something to be done in the future I guess..
	;
	*,cname,3600,neptune.local
	;
	; 
	; PTR RR consists of: zone, PTR, ttl of RR, name	(no spaces)

	*,txt,3600,"this is a text"

; close zone
}

; pretty straight forward
