.Sh NAME
.Nm dddctl
.Nd control and manage delphinusdnsd
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar command
.Op Ar arg ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is used to control, manage and sign delphinusdnsd (zone files)
.Pp
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm bindfile Ar zonename zonefile
Convert a 
.Xr delphinusdns.conf 5
zonefile to BIND format with the specified zonename domain name.
.It Cm configtest Ar [configfile]
Test the entire config, alternatively you can test a
.Xr delphinusdns.conf 5
config file by specifying such a file.
.It Cm help Ar [command]
provides an in-binary help.  Alternatively you can specify a subcommand 
to provide help for.  Ie. 
.Nm
help sign.
.It Xo Cm sign 
.Op Fl KZ
.Op Fl a Ar algorithm
.Op Fl B Ar bits
.Op Fl e Ar seconds
.Op Fl I Ar iterations
.Op Fl i Ar inputfile
.Op Fl k Ar KSK
.Op Fl m Ar mask
.Op Fl n Ar zonename
.Op Fl o Ar output
.Op Fl S Ar pid
.Op Fl s Ar salt
.Op Fl t Ar ttl
.Op Fl z Ar ZSK
.Xc
performs signing operations on a zonefile for DNSSEC operations.
.Bl -tag -width "-I iterations"
.It Fl K
create a new KSK key.
.It Fl Z
create a new ZSK key.
.It Fl a Ar algorithm
use algorithm (integer).
.It Fl B Ar bits
use number of bits (integer).
.It Fl e Ar seconds
expiry in seconds.
.It Fl I Ar iterations
use (integer) NSEC3 iterations.
.It Fl i Ar inputfile
use the inputfile of unsigned zone.
.It Fl k Ar KSK
use provided KSK key-signing keyname.
.It Fl m Ar mask
run the following masked functions (used for debug).
.It Fl n Ar zonename
run for zonename zone.
.It Fl o Ar output
output to file, may be '-' for stdout.
.It Fl S Ar pid
sign with this pid ('KSK' or 'ZSK' if used in conjunction with [-ZK]).
.It Fl s Ar salt
salt for NSEC3 (in hexadecimal).
.It Fl t Ar ttl
time-to-live for DNSKEY's.
.It Fl z Ar ZSK
use provided ZSK zone-signing keyname.
.El
.It Cm sshfp Ar hostname [-k keyfile] [-t ttl]
produces an SSHFP output on stdout in 
.Xr delphinusdnsd 8
format.
.It Cm start Ar [configfile]
starts
.Xr delphinusdnsd 8
with an optional configfile.
.It Cm stop
stops delphinusdnsd by means of signal on a pidfile.
.It Cm restart
restarts delphinusdnsd by means of signal on a pidfile.
